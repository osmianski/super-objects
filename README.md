# Super objects

`osmianski/super-objects` package provides a base class for creating super objects in PHP. How a super object is different from its "traditional" counterpart: 

1. Its "lazy" properties are computed only once and only when they are accessed. Lazy properties, among other things, make dependency injection blazing fast and elegant.
2. :) more features to come :)
